<!-- Introduction to React Exercises

Part 1

For this assignment you will be creating three components:

FirstComponent, which is an h1 with the text "My very first component."
SecondComponent, which is an h2 with the text "My second component."
NamedComponent, which is a p that should accept a property of "name" and display the text "My name is " + name.
All of your components should be created with pure JavaScript and HTML.
